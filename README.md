- 👋 Hi, I’m @Cluso99
- 👀 I’m interested in designing and programming microprocessor based boards. Over the past 10+ years I have concentrated on the Parallax Propeller P1 and P2 which are 8 core 32-bit micros.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the WCH CH552/CH554/CH558/CH559 micros.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on WCH CH552/CH554/CH558/CH559 code and designs.
